# My solutions for CS50P
This repository contains my solutions for the CS50P course assignments (including problem sets and one final project)

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code in this repository for learning and reference purposes. However, please keep in mind that it is essential to understand the concepts behind the code and implement solutions independently for your own learning experience. Using these solutions directly without understanding them would be against the principles of academic integrity.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the CS50P course for providing an excellent learning experience. 
If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me. https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/
